## Measure before optimizing

Use Lighthouse and React DevTools Profiler to identify the real bottlenecks.

## Focus on rendering efficiency

- Memoize expensive computations.
- Split components by interaction boundaries.
- Defer non-critical code with dynamic imports.

## Optimize assets and delivery

Use optimized image formats, lazy-loading, and strong caching policies to reduce initial load cost.
