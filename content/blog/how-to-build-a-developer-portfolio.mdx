## Start with proof, not just claims

Lead with outcomes: metrics, shipped products, and technical decisions.

## Structure your pages for user intent

Use a clear navigation with Home, About, Projects, Experience, Blog, and Contact. Each page should answer one core question from recruiters or clients.

## Keep the contact path frictionless

Add a mailto link, social profiles, and a quick contact form with validation.
